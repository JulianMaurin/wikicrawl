# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, however, to keep coherence in the development process, a preliminary discussion must define its precise scope.
In this context, a pull request should be the result of an opened [issue](https://github.com/JulianMaurin/wikicrawl/issues). Feel free to open an issue to start the discussion. If you wish to resolve an existing issue, please make yourself known in the comments of this one.
